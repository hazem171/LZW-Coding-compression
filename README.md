# LZW-Coding-compression

Implementing a function for the LZW coding compression applied to gray-scale image. The function takes the gray-scale image as an input and outputs the dictionary, the output code for the input image and the compression ratio appliedto the image “Camera2.jpg”. 
 
Attached files: 
• The output dictionary saved in a text file named “Dict.txt”.
• The ouput binary string of the image named “LZWCode.txt”. 
• The compression ratio saved in a text file named “CompRatio.txt”.
